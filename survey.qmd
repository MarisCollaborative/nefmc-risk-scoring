:::{.sd_page id=commercial_pg}

### Commercial Fishery Characterization
Answer the following questions and move the slider to select the factor score based on the rubric underneath:</br>
  1. Is revenue concentrated in ports (look at top 3 ports by revenue) with low catch diversity? </br>
  2. Is the market value decreasing (i.e. price per pound)? </br>
  3. Does information from the most recent fishing year suggest any warning signs about the fishery? </br>
</br>
*Fishery specific questions:*</br>
  - Scallops: Is landings per unit effort decreasing (LPUE)?</br>
  - Groundfish: Are lease prices decreasing?</br>
  - Monkfish: Is days-at-sea (DAS) usage decreasing?</br>
</br>
*If quota for this species is needed to catch another species, move one box to the left.*</br>

```{r}

### Recreational Fishery Characterization
Answer the following questions and move the slider to select the factor score based on the rubric underneath:</br>
  1. Is recreational fishery diversity from the SOE report declining over the last five (5) years? </br>
  2. Are the number of angler trips targeting the species declining over the last five (5) years? *Targeting means MRIP "target" or "secondary target"*</br>
  3. Is the PSE for total catch greater than 30 in the last three (3) years?</br>
  4. Has there been a change in the recreational regulations within the last twelve (12) months?</br>
